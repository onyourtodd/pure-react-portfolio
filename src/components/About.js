                <p>I am fanatical about all aspects of web development. From UI to optimization for production, I love it
                    all. Give me a problem and I will solve it.</p>

                <p>If you would like to work together on a project, or just want to talk tech then please shoot me a
                    message. I would love to hear from you!</p>

                <p>* This site is currently a living experimental portfolio and is being constantly updated to test new
                    tech.</p>
